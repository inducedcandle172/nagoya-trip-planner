To create the Mount Fuji favicon:

1. Create a 32x32 pixel PNG image
2. Use a simple design with:
   - White background
   - Blue sky gradient at the top
   - White snow-capped mountain in the middle
   - Dark base at the bottom
3. Save it as 'fuji-icon.png' in the images folder

The icon should be simple and recognizable even at small sizes.
